TL;DR


Open Meta is an open source SDK for game engines such as Unreal engine 5 and Unity enabling simple integration of NFTs in games, virtual experiences and the open Metaverse. The aim of this project is to enable a bridging mechanism which will allow existing NFTs to be used as digital assets ( As an example; game characters, in-game items, levels, and more) and allow these digital assets to be fully interoperable within an open ecosystem as well as allowing them to gain unlimited utilities.
